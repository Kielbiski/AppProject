Quest (medieval-themed card game).
COMP3400 project at Carleton University. Professor: Dr. Jean-Pierre Corriveau.

Developed using Java and JavaFX, and managed by Maven.
Dependencies can be found in pom.xml

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2017.3.3

To run:
Download JAR from AppProject/Quest/out/artifacts/Quest_jar/Quest.jar.
The JAR is an executable and can be run by double-clicking the file.

Current code does not reflect contents of JAR, as game became networked instead of hotseat. The JAR is an archive of a fully-functioning version before networking was added.

Networked version runs but is buggy, due to JavaFX UI process thread updating issues.

To test game, run the JAR. To contribute, fork repo.
